The banh mi board at Monsieur Vo, bougie as it sounds, is a genius solution to this dilemma, with the sandwich components laid out like a charcuterie plate. That’s only one of the hits at this lively East Village restaurant with flowery, dark blue wallpaper, arches, and warm, welcoming lighting. This is good choice for a casual date night, or a catch-up with friends—get the fried okra and tamarind ribs, and, if you’re sharing with a few people, order the impressive beef shank or whole fried sea bass.

       "'Naming a place after a dish may seem lazy, but it’s actually bold. You have to be able to back it up, and Steak Frites does, serving textbook interpretations of classic bistro food—including a flawless version of its namesake dish. If you’re looking for something  smothered in foam under a smoke-filled cloche, go elsewhere. If you’re looking for straightforward, satisfying French fare, go to Steak Frites.\\xa0 Appropriately, this Hell’s Kitchen restaurant looks like the end result of a director telling a set designer: “Build me a neighborhood Parisian bistro where we can film our meet-cute.” Worn wood furniture, distressed gold-framed mirrors, and vintage cartoon postcards make this place feel decades old. It’s bustling, loud, and cramped, with waiters constantly bumping into each other, and glasses getting knocked over about once every hour. If you come often enough, you’ll eventually break something too, unless you score a seat at the less chaotic bar. Ordering here involves no major plot twists. Beef and fries are the leads, and they&apos;re what you should prioritize. There are four different cuts of meat, and while you could go for the côte de boeuf or chateaubriand for two, you&apos;ll do just fine with the $38 hanger steak. Order it medium-rare, and it  comes out medium-rare, with just the right amount of salt. The fries are an equal partner in this marriage. They’re thin, crispy, and just fluffy enough. Steak Frites&apos; supporting cast shines as well. The onion soup, blanketed with a perfectly browned layer of cheese, and the salade Lyonnaise both look and taste like renditions you might learn to make at Le Cordon Bleu. And we prefer the very saucy gnocchi Parisienne—our favorite non-steak entrée here—to the well-known version at Frenchette.\\xa0 Most of the characters feel familiar, but Steak Frites isn’t without its charming quirks. The escargots “salad” has snails—sans shells— tossed with buttery chunks of baguette and, oddly enough, celery. It defies expectations, but works well. A few things (the jumbo shrimp cocktail, a gruyère omelette) don&apos;t quite match up to  the higher standard set by the signature dishes, but they&apos;re easily ignored. Should more restaurants start naming themselves after the dish that most defines them? Who’s really going to object if Via Carota changes its name to “Cacio E Pepe?” And if Katz’s suddenly switches all their signage to read “Pastrami on Rye,” we would all be like, “Sure, checks out.” Does Steak Frites live up to its simple but audacious name? Absolutely.  Food Rundown\\n\\n\\nEscargots De Bourgogne\\n\\nThink of this dish as a panzanella with snails. It comes with chunks of baguette soaked in parsley-garlic butter, like saturated croutons. The addition of sliced celery isn’t traditional, and makes every bite a little less decadent. But we like it, and if you disagree, you can always pick the celery out.\\n\\n\\nPâté De Campagne\\n\\nSure, you can pick up a slab of terrine at your local fancy grocer. But you’d have to put in a lot of work to prepare all the accoutrements (red radish, cornichons, raspberry coulis, and toasted bread drizzled with a ton of oil) that come with this dish. Make sure this is one of the starters on your table.\\n\\n\\nSalade Lyonnaise\\n\\nSo many elements have to be just right for a very good salade Lyonnaise. The egg has to be perfectly poached, the lardons thick and not too crispy, and you can’t drown the frisée with too much sherry vinaigrette. The kitchen here nails everything, and they also toss in chips made from fingerling potatoes, which is a nice textural addition.\\n\\n\\nGratin De Gnocchi À La Parisienne\\n\\nThe velvety, mashed potato-like consistency and crispy exterior of these gnocchi are reason enough to order this entrée. But it also comes with mushroom fricassée, and no shortage of mornay, so make sure you have plenty of complimentary sesame sourdough and baguette on hand. There are zero things wrong with this dish.\\n\\n\\nHanger Steak\\n\\nIf it was 1952, we’d come to Steak Frites in the middle of the week for lunch, get this steak with a martini, smoke a cigarette, and go back to work. If for some reason you don’t get the default order here, you should still go for a side of fries and one of their sauces (like au poivre or béarnaise) for dipping.\\n\\n\\nDry-Aged NY Strip\\n\\nMuch bigger than the hanger steak, this cut is a good alternative if you’re really hungry. It’s a thick, juicy steak—the kind you’d order at a traditional steakhouse—and comes with a slab of butter.\\n\\n\\nÉclair À La Noisette\\n\\nYour server will try to push the chocolate soufflé (partially because it takes about 20 minutes to make, so they need a heads-up). We prefer this éclair though. It’s covered in a crackly caramelized layer, stuffed with whipped hazelnut cream, and topped with dark chocolate sauce. Do chocolate and hazelnut ever not taste awesome together? '"

       "'Take a moment to picture the anarchic realm of St. Marks between 2nd and 3rd Avenues. See the puffing clouds of blueberry vapes, the exodus of NYU juniors toting packs of pore-minimizing face masks, and the folding chair in front of Mamoun’s where a man dressed like the year 1983 asks if you’re interested in adding CBD to your falafel.  Now, imagine the opposite: the peaceful chortle of a waterfall, friends clinking Tsingtao bottles under indoor thatched roofs, wafts of beautifully smoked fish and braised pork slick and glossy in a caramelized soy sauce. CheLi, a serene, banquet-style Shanghainese restaurant, exists just a staircase away from the belly of St. Marks, but you’d never know it once you’re inside. New York has plenty of places to eat Shanghainese food with a group (you could walk 50 steps from CheLi and ride off into the sunset with a bunch of xiao long bao at The Bao). Even still, we can’t think of many restaurants overtly spotlighting food from the Jiangnan region surrounding Shanghai — an area known for its seafood-dominant cuisine that incorporates plenty of sugar, soy, and Chinese rice wine from the Zhejiang province. Our favorite ordering method at CheLi relies mainly on fish and crustaceans, like meaty Atlantic blue crab soaked in floral Shaoxing wine and sticky slices of carp that are marinated and fried until they taste smoky. But there’s plenty of delicious pork to be eaten, too — the stacks of red braised pork belly coated in a dark soy sauce, in particular, are requisite ordering. And don’t leave CheLi without trying some pillowy-fried tofu bites. Lightly dusted in mala spice and black sesame seeds, each cube crunches then squishes. We’d sneak a plate of these into a movie theater. A night at CheLi could just as easily zhuzh up your average weekday as it could your next big group celebration. The energy feels festive, even on random Tuesdays in the wintertime when everyone silently wishes they lived on a different coast. Once you see the room, it won’t be hard to understand why: the place is decorated to the nines. You’ll sit underneath a hay-thatched roof with lanterns and fake dried pork sausage hanging from the wooden beams above.  Bring a couple friends for your next group dinner, whether there’s an occasion to celebrate or not. Just be aware that this place gets busy and only takes reservations for groups larger than five. (We’ve happily passed hour-and-a-half wait times at Sake Bar Decibel around the corner.) Follow our food rundown for a compilation of all of the hits we’ve tried during our meals here. Once your table is overloaded with the platonic ideal of sweet, delicate seafood and savory pork, you’ll be all set up for one of your favorite NYC Chinese meals in recent memory. Food Rundown\\n\\n\\nSmoked Fish\\n\\nIf you’re currently picturing a tiny plastic tub of whitefish you might buy at a Jewish deli on Houston Street, know that CheLi’s smoked fish is entirely different. It’s the dark brown, syrupy sauce that makes these marinated-then-fried filets taste smoky, rather than any smoking process. Cold and slightly crisp on the outside, these filets are shaped like little hearts, which makes sense because that’s where they live now. (In our hearts.)\\n\\n\\nFried Tofu Bites\\n\\nWhat seems like an endless supply of fried tofu with pillowy centers. Your tongue will alert you to a light snowfall of mala spice on these tiny cubes, and that’s partly what makes them scientifically addictive. You’re going to have to force yourself to stop eating them. Or don’t, and just eat what is essentially spiced popcorn tofu for dinner.\\n\\n\\nBraised Pork Belly\\n\\nOne of Shanghai’s more famous dishes, CheLi’s version comes with starchy rice balls in a thick soy-based sauce. This dish is sweet, rich, and meaty at the same time, not completely unlike the inhabitants of Equinox’s weight room.\\n\\n\\nWine-Soaked Atlantic Blue Crab\\n\\nThere’s a bunch of crab on the menu at CheLi, but we think this particular dish remains unmissable. Commit to getting a little messy, and pick up one of the four inner sections with your hands. That way, you can suck out all of the fragrant, Shaoxing-wine-sopped meat. Served in its shell with the top slightly ajar, it’s as if this crab is tipping its hat to you and saying, “Yes, I know I am delicious. You’re welcome.”\\n\\n\\nSteamed Prawns With Glass Noodles\\n\\nThe prawns in this dish are butterflied so that they look like they’re doing the splits on top of a pile of slippery glass noodles. There’s plenty of garlic and scallions at play, notably present in a potent puree that you’ll want in every single bite. Is anyone shocked that sweet prawns, garlic puree, and springy glass noodles make for a good combination? Alright then.\\n\\n\\nXiao Long Bao\\n\\nThese pork-filled soup dumplings certainly rank higher than your average xiao long bao, but you don’t have to order them with the same fervor as you would the other dishes. If xiao long bao seems like a non-negotiable table priority, great. If not, press on.\\n\\n\\nSong Dynasty Steam Bun\\n\\nImagine the airy texture of cotton candy inside a steamed bun with the surface area of a painter’s palette. The bun itself doesn’t have a ton of flavor (it’s not filled with anything), but that doesn’t mean it’s not fun to pull apart and stuff into your pie hole.'"

Their dining room is always lively, and the soup dumplings are on every table. They have two options on the menu (crab with pork and just pork), and you should absolutely get at least one order of each. The wrappers are delicate, there’s a perfect ratio of meat to soup, and they’re always piping hot. Depending on the size of your group, you could come here for a couple orders of soup dumplings and be in and out in under 30 minutes.

      "Review: If you aspire to be an Expert Level New Yorker, there are a few skills you’ll want to master. You’re going to need to know which subway car to get on for efficient exiting, at least on your own line. You should most certainly know how to avoid a broker’s fee. You should know how to politely not have a moment for the environment when a guy with a clipboard comes for you (sorry) and when to order delivery so that a hot meal is ready and waiting for you just as you get home. Another thing you should have down pat as an Expert Level New Yorker? You should be able to get dropped in Chinatown, and quickly navigate those around you to a great, somewhat under-the-radar spot, where you’ll tell everyone about the best thing to order. When you find yourself in this situation, direct your group to Noodle Village. Tell everyone they have the best wonton soup in Chinatown, and that the soup dumplings are pretty good too. You won’t be lying. If your experiences with wonton soup have been relegated to slippery, doughy wontons filled with little bits of pork dropped into an oily soup, a trip to Noodle Village will change your perspective. The soup is light and doesn’t just taste like something that came from a can, and the wontons are thin and filled with big chunks of shrimp. Since trying the wonton soup here, we find it hard to walk near Chinatown on a cold day without going in. And after trying some other places up the block with reportedly good wonton soup, we can confirm that Noodle Village’s is indeed something special. The space is nothing too notable, but it’s a calm, not overly cramped room that seems like it’s been recently renovated. You can come with a reasonably sized group, or roll in by yourself. And just like that, it’s New York, Expert Level: Unlocked. Food Rundown\n",

But unlike some mainstream fanaticisms (or New York sports teams for that matter), Han Dynasty’s Szechuan food is exactly as good as the hype suggests. The original Han Dynasty started in Philly before opening up a few locations around New York. As much as we’ve enjoyed everything we’ve had here, we typically order the same six-ish things on repeat - mostly because we’d be too sad eating here without them by our side. The dan dan noodles and wontons in chili oil are both essential sharing items. As for mains, we suggest trying the excellent and numbing mapo tofu as well as dry pepper-style chicken draped in chiles. Stop by Han Dynasty’s 3rd Avenue location for covered outdoor dining or to pick-up a few quart containers of food that will significantly improve your Thursday night. Food Rundown\n",

Uplifting news for you: Szechuan Mountain House exists. The Szechuan food here is memorably numbing and garlic-heavy. If you’re interested in outdoor dining, there’s a patio area out front that’s decorated with plants and dividers where you can hang out and drink a few bottles of Tsing Tao to offset the mala spice.  No matter what you order, your meal starts here with complimentary homemade pickled cabbage and ends with cold mung bean soup. In between, we’d suggest getting the mapo tofu, which is both stomach-vibrating and delicious, as well as the pork belly with garlic. It’s possible you’ve seen pictures of it on social media: it comes with cucumbers and light-pink, thinly sliced pork slabs hanging neatly over a rack that looks like something you’d use to dry jeans. Combined with a helping of garlic paste on the side of the plate, the cold cucumber and fatty pork will temporarily convince you this is the only way we should be eating pork belly. Szechuan Mountain House is open for indoor dining, outdoor dining, and takeout - and they also have a location in Flushing in case that&apos;s more convenient to you.\n",

      "\n",
      "Review: Much like a bodega without a credit card minimum or a Facebook video that makes you feel like a more complete person, a good group-dining place can be hard to find. Typically, you need something that’s spacious, not-too-pricey, and at least somewhat good-looking, in case you have a friend who’s saving up for real estate in Calabasas and needs to document every life experience on social media. Also, the food should be good. Fortunately, Birds of a Feather meets all of these criteria. It’s a Szechuan place in Williamsburg, and it’s perfect for a dinner with friends when you want to eat somewhere nice, but don’t want to spend a crazy amount of money. The menu here is huge, few things cost over $20 (with gratuity included), and the space looks like a store that would sell yoga mats made from recycled yoga mats. It’s bright and roomy, with some big windows up front and a communal table in the middle. One thing you should know, however, is that the bar isn’t very big (or comfortable) - but you shouldn’t be dining solo here anyway. The best way to enjoy Birds of a Feather is with a group. Why? Well, first off, conversation is nice. You might even say it enhances a meal. Also, you’ll want to try a little of everything here. Start with the soup dumplings and wontons in chili oil, and go from there. As for entrées, you can get anything from a whole steamed fish to some tea-smoked duck. For something spicy and crowd-pleasing, order the Chungking or three-pepper chicken. With only a few exceptions (the mapo tofu isn’t our absolute favorite version), the food here is very good. So go ahead and stop by with some friends. It’ll make everyone happy, and that’s a rare thing - like a Facebook video that isn’t somehow cat-related or a subway conductor who asks, “Everybody in?” Food Rundown\n",
