      "Review: The dinner you have before you go out is very important. It sets the tone for the rest of the evening, and if you go somewhere boring, you may end up falling asleep standing up later on the dance floor. So, the next time you’re looking for a relatively affordable pre-going out dinner in the East Village, go to Dora’s, a Peruvian spot where the sangria comes in at least six different flavors, and the music plays at a club-level volume. The large, casual space has plastic chairs, a full bar, and a Good Vibes sign that is only sometimes turned on. Order a bunch of ceviches to share, a few rounds of sangria, and maybe even a paella. And if your night begins and ends here, we think that’d be just fine with Dora.\n",

But there’s just something about Jean’s. You can sit in a leather booth, across from a table of people who walk runways, and eat kohlrabi blanketed in tuna carpaccio, and a burger with creamy “fondue” cheese and fried onions. Then a cookie that is actually the size of your head, and a glass of bourbon milk. While sipping your fourth chili-oil spiked martini of the evening, it might occur to you—the simple life is good and all, but there’s just something about living lavishly.\n",

Decompress at the booths while waiting for your flight home after a week-long trip to your parents’, or hang out while firing off a few emails and doing some last-minute research before heading to Paris. Go for the fried green tomato BLT or buttermilk-brined fried chicken that’s perfectly crisp and juicy.\n",

      "Review: There is no &quot;right&quot; time to go to a bakery, but the best time to visit Bread & Butter in Bed-Stuy is around 11am, when they begin selling savory pastries. That way, you can try both an ube morning bun and some frito pie, while watching them grate pecorino onto your two-inch thick, olive oil-soaked, cacio e pepe focaccia. This isn’t a place where you just get one thing—instead, you order the whole menu, and spend the week finishing it all. Bread & Butter (formerly Back Alley Bread) began as a pop-up selling beignet-like &quot;angel donuts&quot; before moving into this spot on Rockaway Avenue. Sit at a small, mismatched table, and indulge in an assortment of pastries with some coffee as you gaze out of the big windows.\n",
